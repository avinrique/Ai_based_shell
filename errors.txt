The error message indicates that the command `google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud ml language v1beta2 analyze entities --content "tell me a joke"` returned a non-zero exit status, which means that the command failed to execute successfully. The most likely reason for this is that the `google-cloud-sdk` package is not installed on your system.

To install the `google-cloud-sdk` package, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
```

Once the package is installed, you should be able to run the command without encountering the error.

Here is the corrected command:

```
google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud ml language v1beta2 analyze entities --content "tell me a joke"
```
