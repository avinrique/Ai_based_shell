The error message indicates that the command `open -a "Google Chrome" daniel.html` returned a non-zero exit status of 1. This means that the command failed to execute properly.

There are a few possible reasons why this command might have failed:

* The file `daniel.html` does not exist.
* The file `daniel.html` is not readable by the current user.
* The command `open` is not installed on the system.
* The command `open` does not have permission to open the file `daniel.html`.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the file `daniel.html` exists in the current directory.
2. Check if the file `daniel.html` is readable by the current user.
3. Check if the command `open` is installed on the system.
4. Check if the command `open` has permission to open the file `daniel.html`.

If you have checked all of these steps and the command still fails, you can try the following command to open the file `daniel.html` in Google Chrome:

```
google-chrome daniel.html
