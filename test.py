    complexity_prompt = f"""You are an advanced AI agent that evaluates natural language prompts to determine if they involve simple or complex tasks. Here's the difference between them:

    - **Simple Tasks:** These are straightforward actions that typically do not pose a significant risk to the system. They usually involve basic operations such as:

    - **File and Directory Management:**
        - Creating directories (e.g., `mkdir project`)
        - Deleting empty directories (e.g., `rmdir old_folder`)
        - Creating empty files (e.g., `touch newfile.txt`)
        - Copying files (e.g., `cp file.txt /backup/`)
        - Moving files (e.g., `mv file.txt /documents/`)
        - Viewing file contents (e.g., `cat file.txt`)
        - Searching for specific text in files (e.g., `grep "search term" *.txt`)
        - Renaming files (e.g., `mv oldname.txt newname.txt`)
        - Listing contents of a directory (e.g., `ls ~/Downloads`)
    
    - **System Information and Status:**
        - Checking system uptime (e.g., `uptime`)
        - Displaying current user information (e.g., `whoami`)
        - Viewing disk space usage (e.g., `df -h`)
        - Checking memory usage (e.g., `free -h`)
        - Listing currently running processes (e.g., `ps aux`)
        - Displaying system logs (e.g., `tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog`)
    
    - **Network Management:**
        - Turning off Wi-Fi (e.g., `nmcli radio wifi off`)
        - Enabling Wi-Fi (e.g., `nmcli radio wifi on`)
        - Checking IP address (e.g., `ip addr show`)
        - Displaying network interfaces (e.g., `ifconfig`)
        - Flushing DNS cache (e.g., `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`)
        - Pinging an address to check connectivity (e.g., `ping google.com`)
    
    - **Basic Configuration:**
        - Changing terminal colors or preferences (e.g., `echo -e "\e[31m"`)
        - Setting environment variables (e.g., `export VAR=value`)
        - Changing the current working directory (e.g., `cd ~/Downloads`)
        - Viewing and editing configuration files with a text editor (e.g., `nano ~/.bashrc`)
    
    - **System Utilities:**
        - Checking for updates (e.g., `sudo apt-get update`)
        - Using basic text editors (e.g., opening a file with `nano file.txt`)
        - Running scripts with known effects (e.g., `bash script.sh`)
        - Monitoring system performance (e.g., `top`)

    - **Complex Tasks:** These tasks can potentially affect the system significantly and may require careful handling or elevated permissions. They often involve:
    - Writing or modifying code (e.g., `echo 'print("Hello World")' > script.py`)
    - Installing or uninstalling applications (
models/gemini-1.5-pro-exp-0801e.g., `sudo apt-get install nginx`)
    - Deleting or modifying system files (e.g., `rm -rf /etc/hostname`)
    - Changing system configurations (e.g., `sudo nano /etc/hosts`)
    - Managing system resources (e.g., `kill -9 PID`)
    - Running scripts that could impact system stability or security (e.g., `./cleanup.sh`)
    - Executing commands that affect multiple files or processes simultaneously (e.g., `find . -type f -exec rm  +`)
    - Risk to System Integrity(e.g. )
    - Network-related configurations (e.g., `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP`)
    - Setting up user permissions (e.g., `chmod 755 script.sh`)
    - Automating tasks via scripts or batch processing (e.g., `crontab -e`)
    - Setting up development environments or databases (e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-venv`)
    - Modifying kernel parameters (e.g., `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`)
    - Performing system upgrades (e.g., `sudo apt-get upgrade`)
    - Backing up system configurations (e.g., `tar -cvf backup.tar /etc/`)
    - Changing the system hostname (e.g., `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new-hostname`)
    - Managing user accounts (e.g., `sudo useradd newuser`)
    - Modifying firewall settings (e.g., `sudo ufw allow 22`)
    - Scheduling tasks with cron jobs (e.g., `crontab -l`)
    - Setting up network services (e.g., `sudo systemctl start apache2`)
    - Changing system locale settings (e.g., `sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8`)
    - Restoring the system from a backup (e.g., `rsync -av /backup/ /`)
